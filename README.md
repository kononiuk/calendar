# Project Title

This project is a dynamic and interactive calendar application built with React.js and TypeScript. The calendar displays a view of a month, with each cell representing a day. Users can create, edit, and delete tasks for each day, with the ability to add multiple tasks per day.

## Features

- **Task Management**: Each cell in the calendar allows for the creation of new tasks. Tasks can be edited and deleted as needed.
- **Labels**: Users can create, edit, and delete labels. These labels can be attached to any task, providing a way to categorize and organize tasks.
- **Drag-n-Drop**: Tasks can be moved between days using a drag-n-drop interface, providing a flexible way to reschedule tasks.
- **Filtering**: Tasks can be filtered by entering a search text and selecting labels, allowing users to quickly find the tasks they're interested in.
- **Import/Export**: The application supports exporting to JSON and importing from JSON for tasks and labels, providing a way to backup and restore data.
- **International Holidays**: The calendar automatically adds international holidays for the next 7 days.

## Technology

The project is written entirely in React.js and TypeScript, providing a robust and type-safe application structure. The only third-party library used is `styled-components` for styling, keeping the project dependencies to a minimum and ensuring a lightweight application.
